# ObeyTheGum

Code for a P5.js sketch I'm making. Images aren't mine, so I didn't include them in the repo. 

You should be able to [watch the sketch](http://sirhamy.com/#/obeythegum) live on my website.

## To run

If you have the P5 IDE downloaded, you can just open the project and run it (provided you supply images for the code to pull in).

Otherwise, you can run it as a webpage by simply opening index.html. If you take this course of action, however, you must make sure
you've downloaded the correct P5 libraries and placed them somewhere index.html can find them. Also, I have a hunch you'll run into some
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues in most common browers so you might need to set up a ["dev" version of your favorite browser](http://www.sirhamy.com/blog/2015/06/google-chrome-set-up-a-blank-chrome-developer-environment-on-windows-to-allow-for-cross-origin-requests/)
or run it on a localhost.
