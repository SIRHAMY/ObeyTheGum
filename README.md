# ObeyTheGum

Code for a P5.js sketch I'm making. Images aren't mine, so don't sue me pls.

You should be able to [watch the sketch](http://sirhamy.com/#/obeythegum) live on my website.

## License

#### Images

I don't own the images, so I can't really give them to you. Do with them as you will.

#### Sketch

As for everything else, I'm sharing with Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Basically you can use and modify my work for free provided that you offer appropriate attribution. 

Proper attribution for me is using my logo in something like "original by *logo*" or linking to my website at sirhamy.com or linking to this repo. Doesn't really matter how you do it so long as people can see I created the original and they have an easy way to check out my grandeur.

TL;DR Don't be an ass and tell people you made what I made. k thx bye.

## To run

If you have the P5 IDE downloaded, you can just open the project and run it (provided you supply images for the code to pull in).

Otherwise, you can run it as a webpage by simply opening index.html. If you take this course of action, however, you must make sure
you've downloaded the correct P5 libraries and placed them somewhere index.html can find them. Also, I have a hunch you'll run into some
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues in most common browers so you might need to set up a ["dev" version of your favorite browser](http://www.sirhamy.com/blog/2015/06/google-chrome-set-up-a-blank-chrome-developer-environment-on-windows-to-allow-for-cross-origin-requests/)
or run it on a localhost.
